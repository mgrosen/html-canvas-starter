# HTML Canvas Starter

Navigating to the html page will open an HTML canvas below a row of buttons that fills the screen. When you click on the screen it draws where the mouse is, and the buttons just change the color to red or blue. 

Things to try doing:
1. Create a paint editor
2. Hook it up to a service to save drawings
3. Create a login/users
4. Try to make it where multiple people can edit a painting at the same time
